This week includes two main areas of learning:

1. Design Principles and Patterns  
2. Data Structures and Algorithms

Each topic contains hands-on exercises to help understand the concepts better.


## Topics Covered

### 1. Design Principles and Patterns

#### Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern  
- Created a Logger class that allows only one instance.  
- Used private constructor and static method to control object creation.  
- Tested and confirmed that the same instance is used everywhere.

#### Exercise 2: Factory Method Pattern  
- Created different document types like Word, PDF, and Excel.  
- Used interfaces and separate factory classes to create each document.  
- Demonstrated how objects can be created without exposing the creation logic.


### 2. Data Structures and Algorithms

#### Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function  
- Created a Product class with basic details.  
- Implemented both Linear Search and Binary Search.  
- Compared their time complexity and found Binary Search to be faster when the list is sorted.

#### Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting  
- Implemented a recursive function to calculate future value.  
- Used a growth rate and number of years as input.  
- Discussed how recursion works and its time complexity.


Each folder contains:
- Java code file  
- Output screenshot  
- A README file of code overview
